  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for pyaudio
Failed to build pyaudio
ERROR: Could not build wheels for pyaudio, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

Solution was this:
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev

then repeat installation by pip
